Run 1:
	Boundaries were 3 separate regions being split at z=-1.5cm and z=1.5cm.
		Each region had 1million points equally distributed on it
	32x4
	50 epochs
	10,000 points per epoch
	train_split = 0.8
	validation_threshold = 1e-6 (never met I don't think)
	No interior scan
	

Run 2:
	Same boundaries as Run 1
	32x8
	everything else same as Run 1
